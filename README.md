Project Overview:
This project aims to predict customer churn within a telecom company by leveraging machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning and implement targeted retention strategies.

Data
The dataset used for this project contains customer-level information including:
Demographic data (age, gender, etc.)
Service usage patterns (voice, data, SMS)
Contract information (type, duration)
Billing details (monthly charges, payment method)
Churn status (target variable)

Methodology:
Data Exploration: In-depth analysis of the dataset to understand data distribution, identify missing values, and explore relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to create informative features.
Model Building: Training and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC) to predict customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy & precision

Results:
In short, the project helps the company keep its customers happy and make more money.
